# Tamalou

I created a simple web app for a card game I like to play called "Tamalou". It's useful as a simple scorecard when you don't have pen and paper and for quickly referencing the rules.

I used NextJS with MaterialUI components and deployed the app using Vercel to [tamaloo.vercel.app/](https://tamaloo.vercel.app/). <br>
